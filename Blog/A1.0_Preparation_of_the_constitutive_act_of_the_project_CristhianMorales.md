- Any activity or challenge must be done using the style **MarkDown with extension .md** and the VSCode development environment, having to be prepared as a document **single page**, that is, if the document has images, links or any external document, it must be accessed from tags and links.
- It is a requirement that the .md file contains a tag of the link to the repository of your document on Github, for example **Link to my GitHub**.
- At the end of the challenge, the created .md file must be uploaded to github.
- From the **.md** file, a **.pdf** file must be exported with the nomenclature **A1.0_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf**, which must be uploaded to classroom within its corresponding section, to serve as evidence of delivery; being this platform **official** here you will receive the qualification of your activity individually.
- Considering that the .pdf file was obtained from the .md file, both must be identical and show the same content.
- Your repository in addition to having a **readme**. md file inside your root directory, with the information as student data, work team, subject, career, data of the advisor, and even logo or images, it must have a section of contents or index, which are really links or **links to your .md documents**, _avoid using text_ to indicate links internal or external.

| Project Name: | Dream Knowledge |
| Project Type: | KMS Sistema de gestión de conocimiento |
| Sponsor: | Yakult |
| Product Owner: | Hector Armando Jaramillo Regino |
| Project Manager: | Edy Jesus Manuely Cota Villa |

This document also provides a description of the current situation, high-level requirements, success criteria, risks and opportunities.|

| Purpose / Justification: |
|---|
| Due to the fact that the knowledge acquired from the employees during their working periods within the companies is lost when they leave. Because of this, it is necessary to develop a system that allows these knowledge to be preserved even though the employee is no longer present. |

| Brief description of the project: |
|---|
| To solve the problem of the loss of knowledge acquired by workers, the development of software is proposed with the ability for workers to create publications accompanied by files that allow them to capture their knowledge or solutions acquired throughout their stay in the company, thus, through the same software, other workers will be able to browse and see this content generated by colleagues, evaluating  publications and acquiring knowledge that would otherwise have been lost. |

| Preliminary scope of the project: |
|---|
| It is expected that the software will allow users to publish their knowledge accompanied by files of various types, allowing changes to the same content if required, that other users can browse and visit the publications, as well as leave ratings and / or comments. It is also expected that the statistics of publications such as the most visited and most helpful content will be visible to administrators. |

| Expected results of the project / Benefits: |
|---|
| 1. Reduction in the loss of knowledge acquired by workers.<br>2. That the knowledge base generated is accessible to all workers. <br>3. Improve the process of solving problems or doubts for employees. <br> 4. Better work performance overall. <br> 5. A source of information to visualize possible improvements within the company. <br> 6. High security for stored information.|

| 2 | It is not possible to offer workers a short course to use the application. | Low | High | Offer a fair use guide when opening the application, so that users themselves can find out how to use it. |
| 3 | The system presents problems to integrate to old systems used by companies. | Low | High | Offer an intermediate software that serves as a bridge for the information to go through. |
| 4 | Users have no interest in using the application. | Medium | High | Promote the company to integrate a reward system for employees who have the most viewed, most used solutions. |
| 5 | Users could make innapropiate/not related posts. | Medium | High | There will be administrator staff to help moderate posts. |

|---|---|
| Basic services (Water and Electricity) | $ 2,000.00 |
| Internet and telephone | $ 4,200.00 |
| Salaries | $ 82,000.00 |
| Stationery | $ 800.00 |

### Conclusions

#### Cota Villa Edy Jesus Manuel
With this activity we start the project, being the constitutive act of the project the document that serves to formalize its beginning and document the initial requirements of this same meeting the needs and expectations of the interested parties. To make this document we read the content based on the information that one of us already had, and from there we developed and corrected the content until we agreed.

#### **Jaramillo Regino Hector Armando**
In this activity, we use a template of the work of one of us and we add some parts of the other works to complete it. To get a better constitutive Act we optain to make a few changes in the redaction of the template and finally translate it. In general, it was a simple activity in which we only joined the work of all the team members.

#### **Dehesa Zazueta Riggel Alioth**
While writting this document I understood the process of formally consolidating a project and the steps it takes, that is, the information required to help better understand the project and all its parts completely. This activity serves as a stepping stone to grow the student's professional capabilities on the work field. 

#### **Morales Arismendi Cristhian Antonio**

During this activity I was able to learn many things, starting with defining the costs that are stipulated during the project, assigning roles for each team member and most importantly defining the project requirements, which is a fundamental part of the project. This charter is carried out in a meeting with the client, that is why it is important to have all the ideas in order.
