# Introduction

## :trophy: A0.1 Learning activity

## Objective

Carry out the context of the case study, as well as a field interview, and finally consolidate the information of the requirements, using the empathize phase proposed by design thinking.

### :blue_book: Instructions

- Based on the information provided by the advisor on the topic of design thinking, empathize phase, carry out the activity indicated in the development section, and if necessary, carry out a brief investigation about **tools to collect information for the analysis of customer requirements**.
- Any activity or challenge must be done using the style **MarkDown with extension .md** and the VSCode development environment, having to be prepared as a document **single page**, that means, if the document has images, links or any external document, it must be accessed from tags and links, and it must be named with the nomenclature **A0.1_NameOfActivity_NameOfStudent.pdf.**
- It is a requirement that the .MD contains a tag of the link to the repository of your document in GITHUB, for example **Link to my GitHub** and at the end of the challenge it should be uploaded to github.
- From the **.md** file export a **.pdf** file that must be uploaded to classroom within its corresponding section, serving as evidence of its delivery, since being the ** official ** platform, it will be received here the rating of your activity.
- Considering that the .PDF file, which was obtained from the .MD file, both must be identical.
- Your repository in addition to having a **readme**.md file in your root directory, with information such as student data, work team, subject, career, adviser's data, and even logo or images, it must have a section of contents or index, which are really links or 
**links to your .md documents**, _avoid using text_ to indicate internal or external links.
- Is proposed a structure  as indicated below, however any other that supports you can be used to organize your repository.

## :pencil2:  Development

1. Taking as a basis the characteristics referred to in the case study and the design thinking proposal, elaborate context, a list of at least **15 questions directed to the client**, such that they can give you detailed information to elaborate the requirements analysis on the case study.

#### Interview

   1. **How would you expect users to access the system?**<br>
   _The software needs to be at LAN level._
   2. **What steps would you expect from the general user when using the application?**<br>
   _That the program includes a search bar, featured topics, as well as a list of the most searched topics._
   3. **Where will users access the system from? (local/remote)**<br>
   _Local._
   4. **What types of users do you expect the system to include?**<br>
   _Three roles: regular users, administrator and the one who generates the content._
   5. **How sensitive / confidential would the information stored in the system be?**<br>
   _Quite a bit, since the content may involve the company's sensitive information._
   6. **Would you like access levels to be available to manage access to the information?**<br>
   _No, everyone can access the information provided by other users._
   7. **Would you expect it to be aimed at users who found how to solve certain problems?**<br>
   _Yes, as in Yahoo Answers._
   8.  **In your company, how old are the employees that would use the platform?**<br>
   _Over 17 years old, but there's no age limit._
   9.  **Which users are able to access the data analytics?**<br>
   _Only high cleareance users._
   10.  **Approximately how many active users will be operating the system at any given time?**<br>
   _Around 4000 to 7000 users._
   11.  **Are users expected to be able to download files?**<br>
   _It's an extra feature, not a requirement._
   12.  **Would you like user accounts to be in control of the company?**<br>
   _We use company data, like existing emails._
   13.  **What colors do you expect the application to include in its user interface?**<br>
   _The ones that resonate with the company, blue and white colors._
   14.  **What do you think of the implementation of user profile pictures?**<br>
   _No, for privacy reasons. The username should be a nickname._
   15.  **Is there a file standard that you would like to handle within the application?**<br>
   _mp4, pdf, ppt (powerpoint), mp3 for audio._<br>

2. Once the interview indicated in the previous point has been carried out, use any of the techniques proposed within the empathize phase of design thinking, you can use another other tool, technique or artifact to consolidate the information collected through the client and elaborate your **business model proposal of the system to be developed**.

**We chose:**
Point of View

**Reason:**
Since our platform will provide information in the way of topics that help users solve problems, we considered the “Point of View” technique of Design Thinking to be the best way to gather our ideas and implement the design of our application. It displays information in such a way that we can analyze the users’ needs, suggest an idea to cover it and why.

**Applying the "Point of View" tool:**

3. Prepare and present your document, consider doing the dynamics as you would do a job in the field or on the client's site, and present it to the advisor and your classmates.

### Conclusions

#### Cota Villa Edy Jesus Manuel
Through the interview we conducted in this activity, we were able to extract new requirements for the development of our project, where we can apply desing thinking tool of Point of View that are used to solidify the points that must be covered in the system by the perpective of the users, it is interesting the existence of tinking design tools that allow to the developers of an application to better understand the points and objectives that an application should have and the different points of view that they offer and now we have a diagram tha allow us to understan much better the extend of our case of use.

#### **Jaramillo Regino Hector Armando**
In this activity we made an improvement to what was our diagram of the last activity, only we implemented some improvements based on the interview carried out in class, it was also interesting to work with design thinking and it was easy to choose the right one for our project, in general It was a very enriching experience which allowed me to experience what an interview is like in the work environment.

#### **Dehesa Zazueta Riggel Alioth**
A client interview was essential in this case study. It helped us better understand ideas that we could adapt to our platform to better serve the users.<br><br>
The “Point of View” Design technique was clear and also easy to use. We tried to use the “Define, Saturate and Group” technique, but we had a difficult time trying to organize our thoughts. Observing the users’ needs and how to provide a solution to them served as good guidance. “Point of View” was useful, efficient and saved us time; a good tool without a doubt.  


#### **Morales Arismendi Cristhian Antonio**
During the process of this activity, I learned a lot, starting with the formulation of the questions and the interview that was carried out to request information. The choice of the design thinking tool and how we have to adhere to it in order to consolidate much more the information that we were able to obtain during the interview and the steps that we must follow with the tool in order to have a business model.
